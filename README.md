# stress-fibre-modeling
Stress fibres are contractile structures that are found in many non-muscle cells consisting of dense bundles of
microscopic filaments. They enable cell movement through the expansion and contraction of the fibres via
the interactions between the filaments that make up the bundle . However, within stress fibres these structures
are highly packed and cannot be tracked using microscopy. Therefore we use modelling and simulation to gain
insight.
